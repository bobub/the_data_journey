This project involved the analysis of data relevant to flights coming in and out of NYC.
It asked 3 vague questions and explored, analysed and modeled the datasets to find answers.

The written answers to those questions can be found in NYC_Flights.pdf

The Jupyter Notebook used to do the analysis is NYC_Flights.ipynb
